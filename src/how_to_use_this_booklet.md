**PureScript Type Classes for JavaScript Developers** is designed as a supplementary guide for JavaScript developers transitioning to PureScript, specifically targeting the concepts covered in chapters 6 through 9 of _PureScript by Example_. These chapters focus on type classes, a powerful but abstract feature of PureScript that can feel unfamiliar to those coming from JavaScript's dynamic and less formalized world. This booklet serves as a drop-in replacement for those chapters, offering a JavaScript-centric perspective to make PureScript's type class system more approachable and intuitive.

### Purpose and Approach

If you're a JavaScript developer, you're likely familiar with patterns like passing functions as arguments, using objects to mimic interfaces, or relying on libraries to enforce structure. However, JavaScript's flexibility can lead to runtime errors and code that's hard to reason about. PureScript's type classes provide a structured, type-safe way to achieve similar goals, with the added benefit of compile-time guarantees. This booklet bridges that gap by:

1. **Starting with JavaScript Concepts**: Each section begins with a familiar JavaScript pattern or technique, such as prototypal inheritance, higher-order functions, or duck typing, to ground the discussion in what you already know.
2. **Introducing PureScript's Abstractions**: We then explore how PureScript's type classes formalize and enhance these ideas, showing how they solve common JavaScript pain points like unpredictable behavior or lack of type safety.
3. **Highlighting Practical Benefits**: Through examples and explanations, we demonstrate why PureScript's type classes make your code more reliable, maintainable, and expressive compared to JavaScript equivalents.

### Who This Is For

This booklet is for JavaScript developers who are:

- Learning PureScript and finding the type class chapters in _PureScript by Example_ (chapters 6–9) abstract or difficult to connect with.
- Comfortable with JavaScript (ES5 or later, including modern frameworks like React or Node.js) but new to strongly-typed functional programming.
- Curious about how PureScript's type system can improve their code compared to JavaScript's dynamic nature.

### How to Read This Booklet

- **As a Companion**: Use this booklet alongside _PureScript by Example_. Each section corresponds to the topics in chapters 6 (Type Classes), 7 (Monoids and Foldables), 8 (Applicative Functors), and 9 (Monads). You may read the sections in this book and then complete the corresponding exercises in _PureScript By Example_.
- **With Code Examples**: Each section includes code snippets in both JavaScript and PureScript to illustrate parallels and differences. We recommend experimenting with the PureScript examples in the REPL (e.g., using `spago repl`) to solidify your understanding. We also recommend completing the exericses in _PureScript by Example_

### What You’ll Learn

By the end of this booklet, you’ll:

- Understand how PureScript’s type classes relate to JavaScript patterns you already use, such as polymorphism or function composition.
- See how type classes like `Show`, `Monoid`, `Functor`, `Applicative`, and `Monad` solve real-world problems in a type-safe way.
- Gain confidence in writing PureScript code that leverages type classes to create robust, reusable, and maintainable programs.

### Prerequisites

To get the most out of this booklet, you should:

- Have a working knowledge of JavaScript (e.g., functions, objects, arrays, and common APIs like `map` or `reduce`).
- Understand the basics of PureScript, such as types, data declarations, and function syntax (covered in chapters 1–5 of _PureScript by Example_).
- Have a PureScript development environment set up (e.g., via `spago` and `purs`) to run examples.

Let’s dive in and demystify PureScript’s type classes by connecting them to the JavaScript world you already know!
